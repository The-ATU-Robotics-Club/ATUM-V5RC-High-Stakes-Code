# VURC Team ATUM
## Hello!
This is the software documentation of VEX University robotics team ATUM from Arkansas Tech University for the 2024 to 2025 game, High Stakes. This documentation is primarily for internal use, to help guide newer programmers throughout the code in a systematic and sleak manner. 

If you are a judge, though, we hope you're liking what you're seeing!
